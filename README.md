### Hi there 👋

⚔️ This is the code for our paper `CUTTANA: Scalable Graph Partitioning for Faster
Distributed Graph Databases and Analytics`. ⚔️

Two main repositories are [`cuttana-partitioner`](https://github.com/cuttana/cuttana-partitioner) and [`application-study`](https://github.com/cuttana/application-study). The first one contains the codes for the actual implementation of Cuttana and the second one is the framework for application study. 

Please do not hesitate to contact me if there is any problem. Building the partitioner should be as easy of running a make command and the application study is containerized. 

## Updates:
We add versions of requirements (g++, make, openmp) as well as documentation about file format and an example file to [`cuttana/cuttana-partitioner`](https://github.com/cuttana/cuttana-partitioner) repository. 

We add an efficient single threaded implementation (without lock-free queues) in `cuttana/cuttana-partitioner` repository.

We added a notation table for easier understanding of paper [here](https://github.com/cuttana/cuttana/blob/main/Notation_Table.pdf). 

Make code cleaner and minor fixes.
